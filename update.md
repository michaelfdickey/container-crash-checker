# Update on Container Crash Checker Script Fixes

## Issue with Handling Multiple Lines of Timestamps

The original script encountered errors when processing files containing multiple lines of timestamps. This was due to the script's inability to correctly parse and handle multiple timestamp values, leading to syntax errors during arithmetic operations and date conversions.

## Changes Made to Fix Syntax Errors

To address the issue, the script was updated to ensure that arithmetic operations and date conversions are performed on individual lines. This prevents the syntax errors previously encountered when the script attempted to process multiple timestamps simultaneously.

## Addition of Error Handling for Invalid Dates

Furthermore, error handling was added to manage cases of invalid dates gracefully. This ensures that the script can continue processing other timestamps even if it encounters an invalid date, improving the robustness and reliability of the script.

These changes have successfully resolved the syntax errors, allowing the script to correctly parse and display crash times without encountering errors.
